## Contributing
Issues and pull-requests are welcome. I'm experimenting with automated release notes/changelog generation. That is why commits should follow the `conventional-changelog-format` enforced by ([Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)).
For a detailed explanation of how commit messages should be formatted, the guidelines are identical to the standard used by [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and described in detail [here](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-message-format)

To use `commitizen` conventional-change-log format for your pull requests, commit your code by using `npm run commit` and follow the prompt.

Pull requests are issued against the `develop` branch, which is set to be the default on github.
